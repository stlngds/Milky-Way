My work with Warsaken began in early 2022 when I was invited on as a game design contracter primarily for Savage Escalation (set 2) - concerned with everything regarding what cards actually *do* in-game, from conceiving new mechanics and cards, to analyzing and constantly reassessing their balance, and everything in-between. I've written extensively about the balance and competitive viability of Warsaken's [past](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juIbu8bGcLx_kI8gyGimEW0Vbp0X7F_qXXNass3ynJc/edit?usp=sharing) and [current](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G_rTO8DUhIsKA8Kr2gI0dnsI-Js9my8SJQgQi0hSiFE/edit?usp=sharing) designs, so go peruse those if you want my hot takes on any particular cards! As well, Savage Escalation is now available digitally and [physically](https://shop.warsaken.com/collections/cards/set-002?sca_ref=5440164.8TaFGVHitz) (I get a commission if you order via that link)! I have also contributed designs to Axioms of Allegiance (the next major set), but you don't get to see those yet.

Beyond the game design work, I was also contracted for web development with Eclectic Nerds, which included improving mobile web app performance while in-game, designing and creating a chatbot and combat analyzer, and building and submitting Progressive Web Apps for the Google Play and Windows app stores.
