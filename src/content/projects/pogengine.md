A simple-ish game engine for a Fundamentals of Game Development course. Written in C++ and OpenGL using Visual Studio plus the ImGui, RapidJSON, and STB libraries, with special thanks to The Cherno for his fantastic OpenGL tutorial video series. Main file (BestSellerEngine.cpp) implements a very simple, legally-distinct tennis game - Ping.
